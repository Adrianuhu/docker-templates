# docker-templates
 
In this repository, you will find different docker-compose.yml files that can be used to deploy each of the applications in an individual Docker container. Each docker-compose.yml file will include the necessary configuration to deploy the application, as well as any dependencies that the application needs to function properly.

To use this repository, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Once you have these tools installed, you can use the following command to deploy one of the applications in a Docker container:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```


This command will start the container for the application and run it in the background. If you want to stop the container, you can use the following command:

```
$ docker-compose down
```

I hope that this repository is useful for those who want to deploy multiple applications using Docker containers. Thank you for using my collection of docker-compose!
